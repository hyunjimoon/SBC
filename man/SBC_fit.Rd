\title{S3 generic using backend to fit a model to data.}
\usage{
SBC_fit(backend, generated, cores)
}
\description{
Needs to be implemented by all backends.
All implementations have to return an object for which you can safely
call \code{\link[=SBC_fit_to_draws_matrix]{SBC_fit_to_draws_matrix()}} and get some draws.
If that's not possible an error should be raised.
