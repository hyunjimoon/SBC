## Preface and Contents

In this vignette, we explain the concept of self-consistency and its potential application for identifying miscalibrations in inference algorithms. We also introduce an iterative process for a finding a prior region with a minimal amount of computational pathologies under a given inference algorithm.

We will give a basic explanation of self-consistency and demonstrate its usage scenario with some examples. 

## Introduction and Explanation

[Simulation Based Calibration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06788.pdf)(SBC) is often used for detecting serious computational issues. The failure of a SBC test is regarded as a result of a computationally unfaithful inference algorithm. Typically the user determines whether it's a failure by analyzing a set of graphical plots, instead of a given criterion.
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '70%', fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Some analysis results of SBC, courtesy of M. Modrak"}
knitr::include_graphics(path.expand("~/git_repos/hyunjimoon/SBC/vignettes/rmarkdown_images/modrak_sbc_results.png"))
```

Like the image above, we can use graphical plots to get a rough idea of the pathological details; under vs over-dispersion, under vs overestimation, and so on.
In general, we inspect the rank plots for uniformity. This is normally done by viewing the plots holistically for obvious deviations, or through quantitative methods like the chi-square test or empirical coverage metrics.
---

We propose a new test metric, based on two concepts, the Data Averaged Posterior and the self-consistency metric. Our motivations is that by taking advantage of the multiple "generate and fit" iterations of SBC, it will give us additional information to construct a more interpretable metric of miscalibration.

We first draw a sample($\theta$) from the prior. Then we draw some data given the drawn prior sample($\pi(y \ | \ \theta)$) with respect to the model's data generating process. And finally, through running inference with the simulated data we obtain some posterior distribution($\pi(\tilde{\theta} \ | \ y)$):

$$
\pi(\tilde{\theta}) = \int \pi(\tilde{\theta} \ |\ y) \pi(y \ | \ \theta) \pi(\theta) \mathrm{d}y \ \mathrm{d}\theta
$$

If we were to take the average of the expectation of the computed posterior, given a faithful inference algorithm, it should equal the expectation of the prior distribution. This is the concept of the Data Averaged Prior(DAP), $\pi(\tilde{\theta})$.

Since we realistically can't compute the exact integral, we normally repeat the "sample-twice-and-fit" process $M$ times. Let $Y \sim f(\theta)$ denote the data generating process, and $\tilde{\theta} \sim \hat{g}(Y, P_\lambda)$ denote the inference algorithm, given some parameterized prior $P_\lambda$. $P_\lambda$ can be parameterized in whichever way, but for simplicity we'll use $P_\lambda = N(\lambda_\mu, \lambda_{var})$. Let $L$ denote the number of posterior samples drawn per iteration. We can then rewrite the DAP computation as the following:

$$
\theta_m \sim P_\lambda, \ Y_m \sim f(\theta_m), \ \tilde{\theta}_m^l \sim \hat{g}(Y_m, P_\lambda) \\
l = 1, 2, \ ... \ , L \\
m = 1, 2, \ ... \ , M
$$

In other words, for each iteration $m$ we draw a prior sample, then simulate some data through the data generating process $f$, and finally generate $l$ number of posterior samples with the inference algorithm $\hat{g}$.

And with the $l$ posterior samples, we're free to compute whatever summary statistic which matches that of the parameterized prior $P_\lambda$. Since we've used the normal prior parameterization, let's go ahead and calculate the posterior mean for each iteration:

$$
\hat{\theta}_m = \frac{1}{L} \sum^L_{l=1} \tilde{\theta}_m^l
$$
Define the computational bias $B$ given some inference algorithm $\hat{g}$ and some parameterized prior $\lambda$, $B(\hat{g}, \lambda)$ as the following:

$$
B(\hat{g}, \lambda) := E[\hat{\theta} \ | \ \theta_{1,...,M}] - \bar{\theta} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_M (\hat{\theta}_m - \theta_m)
$$

Also define the computational variance $V(\hat{g}, \lambda)$ in the same fashion:

$$
V(\hat{g}, \lambda) := \frac{1}{M} \sum_M (\hat{\theta}_m - \bar{\theta})^2
$$
This is probably familiar - it's straight from the bias-variance decomposition of the mean squared error.

So to sum it up, we're still doing the repeated "simulate and fit" thing from SBC. But instead of calculating ranks, we calculate a summary statistic which can be directly compared against the prior. And then calculated the bias and variance which can give us some information on how the inference algorithm is screwing up with this particular prior. When combined with the existing SBC tools and plots, such as the chi-square test for rank uniformity, this gives us a powerful package to identify and diagnose various miscalibrations.

## Demonstration

Okay, so we explained self-consistency and how the bias-variance decomposition can be potentially used for better identifying miscalibration. In order to demonstrate, we're going to mess with a couple of models and find prior regions where the inference algorithm behaves well and poorly. We'll then investigate how these behaviors are represented by the bias and variance metrics. And finally, we'll demonstrate an iterative update scheme whose final aim is to transport initial prior to a more satisfactory region.

Doing the typical library imports here. We'll be using an awesome package that helps us easily perform SBC. Check it out [here](https://github.com/hyunjimoon/SBC) :D
```{r setup, results = 'hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(SBC)
library(cmdstanr)
library(parallel)
library(bayesplot)
library(posterior)
library(dplyr)
library(rstan)
library(future)
library(ggpubr)
library(rstanarm)
library(ggplot2)
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())
plan(multisession)
options(SBC.min_chunk_size = 5)
```

We will be using a modified eightschools model for demonstration:

$$
Y_i \sim \mathrm{normal}(\theta_i, \sigma_i) \\
\theta \sim \mathrm{normal}(\mu, \tau) \\
\mu \sim \mathrm{normal}(0, 5) \\
\tau \sim \mathrm{normal}(0, 5)
$$
The parameter of interest here will be $\tau$. In the original model, a prior distribution of $\mathrm{normal}(0, 5)$ has been set, but we'd like to investigate how other prior regions fare in terms of SBC. So we'll try a grid search on the prior hyperparameters with both HMC and optimization and see how the results differ. Note that since $\tau$ is constrained to be positive, we'll be working with the unconstrained value, $\mathrm{log}(\tau)$ by performing a manual change of variables:

$$
Y_i \sim \mathrm{normal}(\theta_i, \sigma_i) \\
\theta \sim \mathrm{normal}(\mu, \tau) \\
\mu \sim \mathrm{normal}(0, 5) \\
\mathrm{log}(\tau) \sim \mathrm{normal}(\lambda_{\mu}, \lambda_{\sigma^2})
$$
The hyperparameters for the distribution of $\mathrm{log}(\tau)$, $\lambda_{\mu}, \lambda_{\sigma^2}$, will be the subject of the grid search. In addition, the iterative update requires that constraints for hyperparameters be dropped. So for $\lambda_{\sigma^2}$, which denotes the variance, the algorithm will use $\mathrm{log}(\lambda_{\sigma^2})$ instead.

### Setup
We'll set the basic variables here. The number of SBC iterations($M$ in the previous notation) will be set to 100 with 1000 posterior samples($L$). We'll also be rolling with the standard 4 chain setup for HMC:

```{r, cache = TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
## Generator settings
# number of SBC simulations per iteration (generator)
nsims <- 100

# number of observations
nobs <- 10

## Backend settings
# number of draws per posterior approximation 
ndraws <- 1000

# number of chains for hmc posterior approximation
nchains <- 4

fixed_args_eightschools <- list(J = 8, nsims = nsims, sigma = c(15, 10, 16, 11, 9, 11, 10, 18), nsims=nsims, dist_types=list(log_tau="normal"))
```

The `SBC` package allows us to define the prior and data generating process, $P_\lambda,f$, purely in R. This serves two purposes. First, we can verify that the model we have specified is consistent with our intentions i.e. contains no bugs. And we can freely simulate parameters and data without having to call Stan. 

The `generator` function is the prior and data generating process:

```{r, cache = TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
generator_eightschools_cp <- function(lambdas, fixed_args){
  # fixed value across simulated datasets
  nsims <- fixed_args$nsims
  J <- fixed_args$J
  sigma <- fixed_args$sigma
  
  lambda_mu <- lambdas$log_tau$mu
  lambda_var <- lambdas$log_tau$var
  
  # Draw tau from the designated normal distribution
  # lambda_sigma is positively bounded
  log_tau <- rnorm(1, lambda_mu, sqrt(lambda_var))
  tau <- exp(log_tau)
  
  # other parameters are drawn from the default prior
  mu = rnorm(1, 0, 5)
  theta <- rnorm(1, mu, tau)
  # draw y from simulated parameters
  y <- rnorm(J, mu, sigma)
  
  list(
    variables = list(
      log_tau = log_tau,
      tau = tau
      ), 
    generated = list(
      J = J,
      y = y,
      sigma = sigma,
      nsims = nsims,
      lambda_mu = lambda_mu,
      lambda_log_var = log(lambda_var) # unbound sigma
      )
  )
}
```

Note the code line ` log_tau <- rnorm(1, lambda_mu, sqrt(lambda_var))`. Like exactly in the model specification, we are drawing $\mathrm{log}(\tau)$ given hyperparameters $\lambda_{\mu}, \lambda_{\sigma^2}$.

Now we define the HMC and optimizing `SBC` backends, which represent $\hat{g}$.

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
cmdstan_mod_eightschools <- cmdstanr::cmdstan_model("models/eightschools_cp_posteriordb.stan")
backend_eightschools_hmc <- SBC_backend_cmdstan_sample(cmdstan_mod_eightschools, chains = 4, iter_sampling = ndraws / 4)

rstan_mod_eightschools <- rstan::stan_model("models/eightschools_cp_posteriordb.stan")
backend_eightschools_opt <- SBC_backend_rstan_optimizing(rstan_mod_eightschools, draws=ndraws)

calib_generator <- function(lambdas, fixed_args){
  generate_datasets(SBC_generator_function(generator_eightschools_cp, lambdas, fixed_args), n_datasets = fixed_args_eightschools$nsims)
}
```

Finally we define a function that computes the DAP and then calculate bias, variance metrics:

```{r, cache = TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
calculate_dap <- function(lambda_mu, lambda_var, generator, datasets=NULL, backened, fixed_args){
  if(is.null(datasets)){
      lambda_init_eightschools <- list(
        log_tau = list(mu=lambda_mu, var=lambda_var)
      )
      datasets <- do.call(generator, list(lambda_init_eightschools, fixed_args = fixed_args))
  }
  sbc_result <- compute_results(datasets, backened, thin_ranks = 1)
  draws_params <- c()
  draws_Y <- c()
  prior_thetas <- posterior::extract_variable(datasets$parameters, "log_tau")
  theta_bar <- mean(prior_thetas)
  
  B <- 0
  V <- 0
  for(i in 1:nsims){
    draws_Y <- c(draws_Y, datasets$generated[[i]]$Y)
    samples <- SBC_fit_to_draws_matrix(sbc_result$fits[[i]])
    params <- posterior::extract_variable(samples, "log_tau")
    draws_params <- c(draws_params, params)
    
    B <- B + mean(params)
    V <- V + sum((params - mean(params))^2)
  }
  
  B <- B / fixed_args$nsims - theta_bar
  V <- V / (fixed_args$nsims * ndraws)
  
  mu <- mean(draws_params)
  var <- sd(draws_params)^2
  
  return(list(mu=mu, var=var, draws_params=draws_params, draws_Y=draws_Y, B=B, V=V, datasets=datasets))
}
```

Once we have the model and DAP generation we can start the grid search. We create a grid of mean-standard deviation values and run inference with HMC and optimization for each hyperparameter combination. Note that the same prior-data samples are being used for optimization and HMC:

```{r include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
mu_seq <- readRDS(file="DAP_self_calibration_mu_seq.rds")

```

    dap_hmc <- calculate_dap(mu_seq[[i]],var_seq[[j]], calib_generator, dap$datasets, backend_eightschools_hmc, fixed_args_eightschools)

  }
}
```

saveRDS(generated_Y, file="DAP_self_calibration_generated_Y.rds")

```

After waiting quite a bit for the computation to finish, we can compare the results between HMC and optimization. Let's first look at optimization's prior plot:

```{r, cache=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="prior-posterior grid plot of optimization"}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)

scaleFUN <- function(x) sprintf("%.2f", x)
dap_df <- as.data.frame.table(dap_lambda_mu)
colnames(dap_df)[1] <- "mu"
colnames(dap_df)[2] <- "var"
dap_df[, "mu"] <- as.numeric(as.vector(dap_df[, "mu"]))  # not using as.vector converts the factor indices
dap_df[, "var"] <- as.numeric(as.vector(dap_df[, "var"]))
colnames(dap_df)[3] <- "dap_mu"
dap_lambda_df <- as.data.frame.table(dap_lambda_var)
dap_df[, "dap_var"] <- as.numeric(dap_lambda_df$Freq)
ggplot(dap_df, mapping=aes(x="mu", y="var")) + geom_point(aes(x=mu, y=var), color = "red") + geom_point(aes(x=dap_mu, y = dap_var), color = "blue") + scale_y_continuous(labels=scaleFUN) + geom_segment(aes(x=mu, y=var, xend=dap_mu, yend=dap_var), size=0.2, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"))) + xlab("mu") + ylab("var") + ggtitle("optimization")
```

The red points denote the initially specified prior values. Blue points denote the posterior values recovered from the computed DAP. If self-consistency was present, we would need to observe the blue points barely moving away from the red points. For most prior regions, we can see it's not the case.

Let's see if HMC fares better:

```{r, cache=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="prior-posterior grid plot of HMC"}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)

scaleFUN <- function(x) sprintf("%.2f", x)
dap_df <- as.data.frame.table(dap_lambda_mu_hmc)
colnames(dap_df)[1] <- "mu"
colnames(dap_df)[2] <- "var"
dap_df[, "mu"] <- as.numeric(as.vector(dap_df[, "mu"]))  # not using as.vector converts the factor indices
dap_df[, "var"] <- as.numeric(as.vector(dap_df[, "var"]))
colnames(dap_df)[3] <- "dap_mu"
dap_lambda_df <- as.data.frame.table(dap_lambda_var_hmc)
dap_df[, "dap_var"] <- as.numeric(dap_lambda_df$Freq)
ggplot(dap_df, mapping=aes(x="mu", y="var")) + geom_point(aes(x=mu, y=var), color = "red") + geom_point(aes(x=dap_mu, y = dap_var), color = "blue") + scale_y_continuous(labels=scaleFUN) + geom_segment(aes(x=mu, y=var, xend=dap_mu, yend=dap_var), size=0.2, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"))) + xlab("mu") + ylab("var") + ggtitle("HMC")
```

HMC on the other hand is relatively more self-consistent apart from high variance regions.

We'll now plot the bias and variance metrics of optimization and HMC together. Since HMC was relatively well calibrated as to optimization, we should observe its metric being lower than that of optimization:

```{r, cache=TRUE, fig.width = 14, fig.align='center'}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)

B_optim_df <- as.data.frame.table(B_optim)
colnames(B_optim_df)[colnames(B_optim_df) == "Var1"] <- "Mu"
colnames(B_optim_df)[colnames(B_optim_df) == "Var2"] <- "Var"
colnames(B_optim_df)[colnames(B_optim_df) == "Freq"] <- "B_optim"

B_hmc_df <- as.data.frame.table(B_hmc)
colnames(B_hmc_df)[colnames(B_hmc_df) == "Var1"] <- "Mu"
colnames(B_hmc_df)[colnames(B_hmc_df) == "Var2"] <- "Var"
colnames(B_hmc_df)[colnames(B_hmc_df) == "Freq"] <- "B_hmc"

B_hmc_df[, "B_optim"] <- B_optim_df[, "B_optim"]

B_hmc_df[, "coords"] <- paste(B_hmc_df[, "Mu"], B_hmc_df[, "Var"], sep=",")
B_hmc_df[, "coords"] <- factor(B_hmc_df$coords, levels=unique(B_hmc_df$coords))

ggplot(B_hmc_df) + geom_point(aes(x=coords, y=B_optim, color="red")) + ggtitle("B(red=optimization, green=HMC), closer to 0 is better") + geom_point(aes(x=coords, y=B_hmc, color="green")) + geom_segment(aes(x=coords, y=B_optim, xend=coords, yend=B_hmc), size=0.2) + theme(axis.title.x = element_text(margin=unit(c(10, 0, 0, 0), "mm"))) + xlab("mu, var") + ylab("B") + theme(legend.position = "none") + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype="dashed", size=1)
```

The X axis represent the prior mean-variance combinations. The bias metric values are shown on the Y axis. We plotted the bias metric calculated from optimization as red dots, and green dots for HMC. You can see that overall HMC's metrics are lower than that of optimization.

Let's also examine the bias values individually. It appears that when `mu` is equal to 5 or 7, HMC tends to have the highest absolute bias metric.
In addition, high variance priors coupled with high mean values show severe bias for both inference algorithms, and thus should be avoided.

Overall, we can conclude that in order to achieve minimal bias, priors with variance as 1 would the best choice out of the tested priors.

```{r, cache=TRUE, fig.width = 14, fig.align='center'}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)

V_optim_df <- as.data.frame.table(V_optim)
colnames(V_optim_df)[colnames(V_optim_df) == "Var1"] <- "Mu"
colnames(V_optim_df)[colnames(V_optim_df) == "Var2"] <- "Var"
colnames(V_optim_df)[colnames(V_optim_df) == "Freq"] <- "V_optim"

V_hmc_df <- as.data.frame.table(V_hmc)
colnames(V_hmc_df)[colnames(V_hmc_df) == "Var1"] <- "Mu"
colnames(V_hmc_df)[colnames(V_hmc_df) == "Var2"] <- "Var"
colnames(V_hmc_df)[colnames(V_hmc_df) == "Freq"] <- "V_hmc"

V_hmc_df[, "V_optim"] <- V_optim_df[, "V_optim"]

V_hmc_df[, "coords"] <- paste(V_hmc_df[, "Mu"], V_hmc_df[, "Var"], sep=",")
V_hmc_df[, "coords"] <- factor(V_hmc_df$coords, levels=unique(V_hmc_df$coords))

ggplot(V_hmc_df) + geom_point(aes(x=coords, y=V_optim, color="red")) + ggtitle("V(red=optimization, green=HMC), lower is better") + geom_point(aes(x=coords, y=V_hmc, color="green")) + geom_segment(aes(x=coords, y=V_optim, xend=coords, yend=V_hmc), size=0.2) + theme(axis.title.x = element_text(margin=unit(c(10, 0, 0, 0), "mm"))) + xlab("mu, var") + ylab("V") + theme(legend.position = "none") + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype="dashed", size=1)
```

But for variance, we can see that for some prior regions HMC yields a higher variance metric. And as expected, the variance metric scales with the prior variance.

A particularly interesting observation is that we can see the variance metric suddenly spiking with values of prior mean that's greater than 5 for all inference algorithms. This may lead us to believe that the prior region around mean = (5, 10] is a somewhat unfavorable region for the inference algorithms to explore.


### Iteratively prior calibration update

Up to now, we've worked with metrics and identified miscalibrated regions. Can we try and go the other direction? How can we use the prior-posterior discrepency information to refine our prior? In this section, we explore a prior update algorithm which attempts to move from a badly calibrated region to a more well-calibrated area.

The iterative update algorithm uses the metric attained from a calculated DAP to update the prior's hyperparameters. Recall the DAP equation:

$$
\pi(\tilde{\theta}) = \int \pi(\tilde{\theta} \ |\ y) \pi(y \ | \ \theta) \pi(\theta) \mathrm{d}y \ \mathrm{d}\theta
$$

We generate metric from the DAP $\pi(\tilde{\theta})$, which allows us to directly measure the discrepency between it and the prior distribution's hyperparameters, $\pi(\theta) = P_\lambda$. The discrepency can be used to guide a local search along the prior space. The increment of the descent step can be varied, but we provide a few options:

1. "Markov chain"-like: This method reuses the calculated summary statistics of the DAP as the prior hyperparameter values of the next iterations. It's the simplest option, but can be effective for simpler models.
2. Cubic weights: We increment/decrement the hyperparameters in cubic order so that as the discrepency gets smaller, the stepsize also gets smaller. On the otherhand, large discrepency can result in exponential stepsizes which causes the hyperparameters to rapidly shrink towards the DAP summary statistic. It was found that this method was effective in speeding up calibration for priors with a relatively scale-invariant region, since the cubic nature may only allow subtle movements near the ambient region of the DAP statistic.

We'll try to start from a "bad", miscalibrated prior region and try to iteratively refine the prior into a more favorable region. We'll be starting from $N(5, 10)$ with optimization. Let's generate a rank plot as a quick check to see how bad the region is:
```{R, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
lambda_init_eightschools <- list(
  eta = list(mu=5, var=10)
)

datasets_eightschools_new <- generate_datasets(SBC_generator_function(generator_eightschools_cp, lambda_init_eightschools, fixed_args_eightschools), n_sims = fixed_args_eightschools$nsims)

result_eightschools_opt_new <- compute_results(datasets_eightschools_new, backend_eightschools_opt, thin_ranks = 1)
    
plot_rank_hist(result_eightschools_opt_new, variables=list("tau", "log_tau"))
```

We can see that the ranks are not uniform, and thus the starting point is not well calibrated. Let's try the iterative update:

```{r}
updator = "mc_update"

# maximal number of SBC iterations
niter <- 100

# tolerance
tol <- 0.1

# learning rate
gamma <- 1.5 # 0.5 for gradient update, 10 for normal_str_update

sc_eightschools_opt <- self_calib_adaptive(calib_generator, backend_eightschools_opt, updator, c("log_tau"), lambda_init_eightschools, nsims, gamma, tol, fixed_args = fixed_args_eightschools)
```

This algorithm continuously updates the prior with the previous iteration's posterior, which drives the posterior into a well-calibrated region.

```{R, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
sc_eightschools_opt$t_df
```

The iterative update algorithm determined the following $\mu, \sigma^2$ prior to be optimal:

```{r}
sc_eightschools_opt$lambda$var = sc_eightschools_opt$lambda$var ^ 2
sc_eightschools_opt$lambda
```

Let's check the rank plots at the region:


```{R, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
datasets_eightschools_new <- generate_datasets(SBC_generator_function(generator_eightschools_cp,  sc_eightschools_opt$lambda, fixed_args_eightschools), n_sims = fixed_args_eightschools$nsims)

result_eightschools_opt_new <- compute_results(datasets_eightschools_new, backend_eightschools_opt, thin_ranks = 1)
    
plot_rank_hist(result_eightschools_opt_new, variables=list("log_tau", "tau"))
```

The resulting rank plots show that the updated region is a more calibrated region as to the initial region.

## The role of the calibration algorithm and the interpretation of calibrated $\lambda$

The calibration algorithm iteratively updates the prior, $lambda$, in an attempt to move to a calibrated region. This means That its hyperparameter values, mean and standard deviation in the case of the Normal distribution are the target of update. We would like to address the statement of whether basic prior are sufficient in representing computationally calibrated priors.

In the case of the sequential update algorithm, the goal is to allocate high probability dass on desirable regions, and vice versa. The resulting calibrated only conveys the following information:  It was found that the region centered on the resulting distribution was (relatively) well calibrated.

We would believe that in most cases the calibrated prior will not be used directly; instead it will be used as a reference for determining the bounds of the calibrated region. Given this information, domain knowledge will be elicited into an actual prior distribution, while hopefully abiding the calibrated region information.

In conclusion, finding calibrated regions does not involve domain knowledge elicitation and in most cases the simple probability densities may be sufficient just for identifying calibrated regions of the prior. The user then may use this range of values as a reference when defining priors in an attempt for a computationally calibrated prior.

## Wrap-up

We've explored the concept of self-consistency and with prior-posterior grid plots identified prior regions which are deemed to be miscalibrated. Furthermore, we've used two metric, the bias and variance calibration metrics to identify in detail how different prior regions behave with respect to an inference algorithm. 

Finally, we showed by iteratively updating the prior we were able to go from a poorly calibrated region to a well-calibrated region. The hyperparameters of the prior were sequentially updated until relative calibration was reached, giving the user some reference point of a calibrated region to aid in prior construction.
